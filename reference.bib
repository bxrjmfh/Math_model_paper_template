	abstract = {The monitoring and metric assessment of piles of natural or man-made materials plays a fundamental role in the production and management processes of multiple activities. Over time, the monitoring techniques have undergone an evolution linked to the progress of measure and data processing techniques; starting from classic topography to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technologies up to the current survey systems like laser scanner and close-range photogrammetry. Last-generation 3D data management software allow for the processing of increasingly truer high-resolution 3D models. This study shows the results of a test for the monitoring and computing of stockpile volumes of material coming from the differentiated waste collection inserted in the recycling chain, performed by means of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric survey and the generation of 3D models starting from point clouds. The test was carried out with two UAV flight sessions, with vertical and oblique camera configurations, and using a terrestrial laser scanner for measuring the ground control points and as ground truth for testing the two survey configurations. The computations of the volumes were carried out using two software and comparisons were made both with reference to the different survey configurations and to the computation software.},

	abstract = {The abundance of granular materials and powders that are being used in several fields, along with their broad applications, requires a comprehensive understanding of both their macro- and micro-mechanical behavior. The fabric and structural properties, or the inter-particle properties, such as the angle of repose, do affect the behavior of granular materials. This comprehensive review indicates that the angle of repose of granular material is an essential parameter to understand the micro-behavior of the granular material and, then, to relate it with the macro-behavior. Therefore, this extensive review was prepared about the repose angle theory, its definitions, method of measurements, appropriate applications and the influencing factors.},

	abstract = {The automatic excavator can provide the high productivity output and also increase the safety factor by reducing the risk of the operations at the mine sites at the same time. In this paper, we focus on the improvement of soil shape on the dump truck's vessel for a soil loading operation of excavator by bring up a new method which is called flattening operation. The basic concept of this method is to make some parts of steep shape of the soil on a vessel flat by control the movement of the excavator's bucket to be straight toward to the soil on the dump truck's vessel after finishing the soil deposition on the vessel. Firstly, we use a conventional optimization method that can decide the best deposit positions on the vessel. By depositing the soil at the positions we got above, the error between the desired soil shape and the deposited soil shape will be decreased. Next, we conduct the combination between conventional optimization and flattening operation which means the output of the optimization not only decide the best deposit positions but also need to consider the flattening height and the best deposit position may change according to the flattening operation. Finally, we demonstrate both simulation and experimental results and a comparison of the results between the conventional optimization and the new proposed method.  2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In scour simulation models, a sand slide step is necessary to treat the bed areas where the slope exceeds the angle of repose. This exceedance is due to the fact that the Exner equation does not take into consideration the angle of repose. Methods for sand slide should conserve mass, be based on physics, and give a unique final bed configuration. However, there is no existing method that satisfies all these requirements. Most previous methods use either a modified bed-load transport rate based on bed slope or purely geometric corrections. This work proposes a new method that solves a slope-limited diffusion equation. The diffusivity is conditioned upon bed slope. The method is based on the physics of sand slide and its diffusive nature. Special numerical schemes, linear gradient scheme (LGS) and Gauss nonlinear gradient scheme (GNGS), were tested for the evaluation of bed elevation gradient, which is used in the conditional function for diffusivity. LGS gives severe bed distortion due to the time lag for sand particles to slide in the diagonal direction of mesh. GNGS greatly alleviates this problem by using an extended stencil. The new sand-slide method was implemented in a 3D scour model and tested with two cases. Results show that the new sand slide method, in conjunction with the GNGS scheme or the combination of GNGS and LGS, produces efficient, physically correct, and mesh-independent results. The simulated scour hole development compares well with the experiment.},

	abstract = {The morphodynamic evolution of the shape of dunes and piles of granular material is largely dictated by avalanching phenomena, acting when the local slope gets steeper than a critical repose angle. A class of degenerate parabolic models are proposed closing a mass balance equation with several viscoplastic constitutive laws to describe the motion of the sliding layer. Comparison between them is carried out by means of computational simulations putting in evidence the features that depend on the closure constitutive assumption and the robust aspects of the models. The versatility of the model is shown applying it to the movement of sand in presence of walls, open ends, columns, doors, and in complicated geometries.},
